   ### Hi there, I'm Austin ðŸ‘‹ 
   I'm a software engineer who's passions lie in making open-source more accessible, elevating people's lives through technology, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy building with are ReactJS, Python, and Jamstack (Javascript, APIs, Markup). A caption for my life thus far would be to chase your dreams by seeking discomfort. It wasn't until being laid-off due to covid, is when I was first introduced to coding. I'm grateful I can combine my creativity and my joy for helping others through tech.
