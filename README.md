   ### Hello there, I'm Austin ðŸ‘‹ 
   I'm a software engineer who's passions lie in making open-source more accessible, elevating people's lives through technology, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy building with are ReactJS, Python, and Jamstack (Javascript, APIs, Markup). My life as a caption; do whatever you want to do. I love music so I worked as a Free-Lance Audio Engineer out of high school. I wanted to make an impact helping others so I studied to become a Surgical Technologist. It wasn't until being laid-off due to covid, is when I was introducted to coding. I'm grateful I can combine my creativity and my joy in helping others in the tech community!
